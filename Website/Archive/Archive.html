    <div content="content">
        <p style="color: #990011ff ;">On 31 December 2019, WHO was informed of cases of pneumonia<br> 
          of unknown cause in Wuhan City, China. A novel coronavirus<br>
          was identified as the cause by Chinese authorities on<br>
          7 January 2020 and was temporarily named “2019-nCoV”</p>

        <h3 style="color: #990011ff ;">1 January 2020</h3 >

<p style="color: #990011ff ;">WHO had set up the IMST (Incident Management Support Team) across the three levels of the organization:<br>
  headquarters, regional headquarters and country level, putting the organization on an emergency footing for dealing with the outbreak.</p>

        <h3 style="color: #990011ff ;">4  January 2020</h3>
<p style="color: #990011ff ;">WHO reported on social media that there was a cluster of pneumonia cases – with no deaths – in Wuhan, Hubei province.</p>

<h3 style="color: #990011ff ;">5 January 2020</h3>

<p style="color: #990011ff ;"   >WHO published our first Disease Outbreak News on the new virus.<br>
  This is a flagship technical publication to the scientific and public health community as well as global media.<br>
  It contained a risk assessment and advice, and reported on what China had told the organization about<br> 
  the status of patients and the public health response on the cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan.</p>

<h3 style="color: #990011ff ;">10 January 2020</h3>

<p style="color: #990011ff ;">WHO issued a comprehensive package of technical guidance online with advice to all countries on how to detect,<br>
  test and manage potential cases, based on what was known about the virus at the time.<br> 
  This guidance was shared with WHO's regional emergency directors to share with WHO representatives in countries.<br>
  Based on experience with SARS and MERS and known modes of transmission of respiratory viruses, infection and prevention control guidance<br>
  Were published to protect health workers recommending droplet and contact precautions when caring for patients, <br>
  and airborne precautions for aerosol generating procedures conducted by health workers.<br>
</p>

<h3 style="color: #990011ff ;">12 January 2020</h3>
<p style="color: #990011ff ;">China publicly shared the genetic sequence of COVID-19.</p> 

<h3 style="color: #990011ff ;">13 January 2020</h3>
<p style="color: #990011ff ;">Officials confirm a case of COVID-19 in Thailand, the first recorded case outside of China.</p>


<h3 style="color: #990011ff ;">14 January 2020</h3>
<p style="color: #990011ff ;">WHO's technical lead for the response noted in a press briefing there may have been limited human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus<br>
  (in the 41 confirmed cases), mainly through family members, and that there was a risk of a possible wider outbreak. <br>
  The lead also said that human-to-human transmission would not be surprising given our experience with SARS, MERS and other respiratory pathogens.  
</p>


<h3 style="color: #990011ff ;">20-21 January 2020</h3>
<p style="color: #990011ff ;">WHO experts from its China and Western Pacific regional offices conducted a brief field visit to Wuhan.
</p>


<h3 style="color: #990011ff ;">22 January 2020</h3>
<p style="color: #990011ff ;">WHO mission to China issued a statement saying that there was evidence of human-to-human transmission in Wuhan but more investigation was needed<br> 
  To understand the full extent of transmission.
</p>


<h3 style="color: #8B0000 ;">22- 23 January 2020</h3>
<p style="color: #8B0000 ;">The WHO Director- General convened an Emergency Committee (EC) under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005)<br> 
  To assess whether the outbreak constituted a public health emergency of international concern.<br>
  The independent members from around the world could not reach a consensus based on the evidence available at the time.<br>
  They asked to be reconvened within 10 days after receiving more information.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #8B0000 ;">28 January 2020</h3>
<p style="color: #8B0000 ;">A senior WHO delegation led by the Director-General travelled to Beijing to meet China’s leadership, learn more about China’s response,<br> 
  And to offer any technical assistance. While in Beijing, Dr. Tedros agreed with Chinese government leaders that an international team <br>
  Of leading scientists would travel to China on a mission to better understand the context,<br>
  The overall response, and exchange information and experience.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #8b0000 ;">30 January 2020</h3>
<p style="color: #8b0000 ;">The WHO Director-General reconvened the Emergency Committee (EC). This was earlier than the 10-day period and only two days after<br> 
  The first reports of limited human-to-human transmission were reported outside China. This time, the EC reached consensus and advised the Director-General<br>
  That the outbreak constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The Director-General accepted the recommendationv
  And declared the novel coronavirus outbreak (2019-nCoV) a PHEIC. This is the 6th time WHO has declared a PHEIC since the International Health Regulations (IHR)<br> 
  Came into force in 2005. WHO’s situation report for 30 January reported 7818 total confirmed cases worldwide, with the majority of these in China,<br>
  And 82 cases reported in 18 countries outside China. WHO gave a risk assessment of very high for China, and high at the global level.

   which included presentations by George Gao, Director General of China CDC, and Zunyou Wu, China CDC's chief epidemiologist. 
</p>


<h3 style="color: #8B0000 ;">11-12 February 2020</h3>
<p style="color: #8B0000 ;">The WHO-China Joint mission, which included experts from Canada, Germany, Japan, Nigeria, Republic of Korea, Russia, Singapore and the US (CDC, NIH)<br> 
  Spent time in Beijing and also travelled to Wuhan and two other cities. They spoke with health officials, <br>
  scientists and health workers in health facilities (maintaining physical distancing). 
</p>


<h3 style="color: #8B0000 ;">11 March 2020</h3>
<p style="color: #8B0000 ;">Deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction, <br>
  WHO made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic.

    <h1 style="background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">THE END</h1>
    <p>Prospects for the rest of the year and beyond hinge on the questions of whether and when future variants will emerge.<br>
       As long as Omicron remains the dominant variant, there is reason for relative optimism. Our scenario analysis suggests<br> 
       That Omicron-related hospitalizations are likely to continue to decline in the United States and remain at relatively low levels through the spring and summer.<br>
        We might then expect to see a seasonality-driven wave of disease next fall and winter, but hospitalizations would likely peak well below<br>
        The level of the wave we just experienced</p>

        <h2 style="background-color:beige ;color: black;">Pandemic to endemic: Where does one end and the other begin?</h2>
        <p>Several potential definitions of the transition from pandemic to endemic phase are possible<br>
          . Epidemiologically, COVID-19 can be defined as endemic when it exists at a predictable level that does not require society-defining interventions.<br>
           While we all wish that level could be zero, eliminating the disease is not feasible for any country with open borders. <br>
          Previous editions of this article invoked a comparison of the COVID-19 burden to that from other diseases such as flu. <br>
          Just as the risk of flu is considered normal, so too might the risk of COVID-19. In addition, what is considered acceptable by society will differ across countries.<br>
           Countries currently reopening during Omicron wave downswings are doing so amid very different experiences of COVID-19 burden. <br>
          For example, the COVID-19 death rate per capita in the past month for the United States is 50 percent higher than Argentina’s and ten times greater than the Philippines’<br></p>
          
          
          <image src=".\main 2.png" alt="Headlines">
          </image>

          <p>Until a new variant emerges, and under some scenarios even once it does, the United States and Europe will likely continue to move toward these .<br>
            definitions of endemicity. As that happens, countries across Europe are rolling back the last public-health restrictions.<br>
            England plans to end the isolation requirement for those testing positive (and is ending free asymptomatic testing).<br>
            The US CDC recently announced a change in its masking guidelines that serves to significantly reduce the number of areas where masking is recommended.<br>
            Airline passenger volumes in the United States are much closer to prepandemic levels than they were <br>
           a year ago and schools navigated the recent wave with less disruption than was caused by previous waves of disease.</p>


           <h2>Endemic COVID-19 does not mean that the disease poses no risk.<br> 
            Globally, we should aim for an “always on” response system that can scale quickly.<br>
             And as we have written previously, every society must do four things to manage <br>
             COVID-19 effectively during the endemic phase:</h2>

             <ul>
               <il>Choose a holistic set of health, economic, and social markets that they are managing for</il>
               <il>Monitor and track progress against them in ways that allow for targeted response escalation when needed</il>
               <il>Limit disease through effective use of vaccines, therapeutics, and other countermeasures</il>
               <il>Slow transmission through testing and environmental/workplace modifications</il>
             </ul>

              <h2 style="border: #8B0000;background-color: grey;color: black;">A new variant may yet trigger another chapter in the COVID-19 pandemic and societies must be prepared<br>
                To respond if and when that happens. But for now, the pandemic phase looks to be ending.</h2>
