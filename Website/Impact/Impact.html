          IMPACT OF COVID 19
        </h1>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 35px;color: #ffffff;">The COVID-19 outbreak affects all segments of the population and is particularly detrimental to members of those social groups in the most vulnerable situations, continues to affect populations, including people living in poverty situations, older persons, persons with disabilities, youth, and indigenous peoples. Early evidence indicates that that the health and economic impacts of the virus are being borne disproportionately by poor people. For example, homeless people, because they may be unable to safely shelter in place, are highly exposed to the danger of the virus.  People without access to running water, refugees, migrants, or displaced persons also stand to suffer disproportionately both from the pandemic and its aftermath – whether due to limited movement, fewer employment opportunities, increased xenophobia etc.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 35px;color: #ffffff;">If not properly addressed through policy the social crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic may also increase inequality, exclusion, discrimination and global unemployment in the medium and long term. Comprehensive, universal social protection systems, when in place, play a much durable role in protecting workers and in reducing the prevalence of poverty, since they act as automatic stabilizers. That is, they provide basic income security at all times, thereby enhancing people’s capacity to manage and overcome shocks.</p>

      <h2 style="color: #ffffff ;">From equality to global poverty: the Covid-19 effects on societies and economies</h2>
<p style="text-align: left ;color: #ffffff;">From school closures to devastated industries and millions of jobs lost – the social and economic costs of the pandemic are many and varied. Covid-19 is threatening to widen inequalities everywhere, undermine progress on global poverty and clean energy, and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: left ;color: #ffffff;">The best solution is to stop this damage from happening, through the use of tests, treatments and vaccines everywhere they're needed. This will cost only a fraction of the huge economic loss the pandemic is causing every week.</p>

<p style="text-align: left ;color: #ffffff;">To slow the spread of the virus, schools closed across the world. One year into the pandemic, almost half of the world’s students were affected by school closures. Millions of girls in some countries might not be going back at all, putting them at risk of adolescent pregnancy, child marriage and violence.</p>

           the impact of COVID-19 on mental health
        </h2>
        <p style="text-align: center ;color: #494848;">COVID-19 patients are at an increased risk of being diagnosed with anxiety, depression or insomnia. Here’s a closer look at how the SARS-CoV-2 virus can impact your mental health.</p>

<p style="text-align: left ;color: #3b3b3b;">
  Recent research has revealed the toll that contracting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can have on your mental health. The study, published in The Lancet Psychiatry, analysed the electronic health records of 69.8 million patients in the United States, which included 62,354 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Within three months of testing positive, almost 20% of people diagnosed with COVID-19 were then diagnosed with psychiatric disorders, including anxiety, depression or insomnia. One in four of those people had not received a psychiatric diagnosis before. The researchers warned that the results are likely to be underestimates of the actual number of cases. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: left ;color: #302f2f;">
  Researchers from the NIHR Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre and the University of Oxford Department of Psychiatry, also found that people with a pre-existing psychiatric disorder were 65% more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 than those without. The researchers say this finding was unexpected and needs further investigation. In the meantime, they say, having a psychiatric disorder should be added to the list of risk factors for COVID-19
</p>

<p style="text-align: left ;color: #2c2c2c;">
  Sufferers of “long COVID” – who are still experiencing symptoms months after testing positive – also appear to experience mental health issues, which can be triggered by a range of factors including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), lethargy, fatigue and olfactory disorders such as a loss of their sense of smell.
